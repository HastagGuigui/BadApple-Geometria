# Bad Apple on Geometria

i hate myself :3

i did this in like 1-2h chrono

There's the audio file in the game's files, and the json was yoink'd from [Junferno's Bad Apple stuff](https://github.com/kevinjycui/bad-apple)

## How to run this monstrosity?

 - First up, install Geometria's dependencies:

    (just install (Geometria Hub)[https://github.com/Geometria-Engine/Hub] and go through the first boot process, that'll install everything you'll need)

 - Then, clone the project, and compile it (`./geo.exe --compile` on Windows Powershell, `geo.exe --compile` on Windows Command Prompt, and `./geo --compile` on Linux)

 - Then go to the `./Geometria/` folder and run `./badapple.exe` (or `./badapple` if you're on linux)

 - Also, press space to start the anim :D
